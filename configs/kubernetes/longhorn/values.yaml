longhorn:
  ingress:
    enabled: true

    host: longhorn.k8s.frontenac.tech

    ## Set this to true in order to enable TLS on the ingress record
    ## A side effect of this will be that the backend service will be connected at port 443
    tls: false

    ## If TLS is set to true, you must declare what secret will store the key/certificate for TLS
    tlsSecret: longhorn.local-tls

    ## If ingress is enabled you can set the default ingress path
    ## then you can access the UI by using the following full path {{host}}+{{path}}
    path: /

    ## Ingress annotations done as key:value pairs
    ## If you're using kube-lego, you will want to add:
    ## kubernetes.io/tls-acme: true
    ##
    ## For a full list of possible ingress annotations, please see
    ## ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/annotations.md
    ##
    ## If tls is set to true, annotation ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true" will automatically be set
    annotations:
    #  kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    #  kubernetes.io/tls-acme: true

    secrets:
    ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
    ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
    ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ##
    ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
    ## If you're using kube-lego, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
    ##
    ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
    ## Please see README.md for more information
